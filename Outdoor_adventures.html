    <h1 id="Hiking">Hiking</h1>
    <p>In a city where its most famous landmark is a mountain, it's only fitting that in this picture comes a wide selection of hiking and walking trails to discover and enjoy. Some of the most popular hiking trails in Cape Town include Skeleton Gorge, Lion's Head, Kasteel Poort, Devil's Peak and Elephant's Eye.</p>
    <h3>Skeleton Gorge</h3>
    <p>Known for its popularity among locals and tourists, Skeleton Gorge is a scenic trek not rivalled by many. Ideal in dry conditions, this hike is great for both the seasoned and novice hiker. During the summer months you’ll be able to get some shade along the Afromontane forest nearly all the way up Skeleton Gorge. Bear in mind that this hike can get quite strenuous so be prepared to really work those muscles, and take the necessary safety precautions.</p>
    <h3>Lion's Head</h3>
    <p>This short summit offers panoramic views of Cape Town and unbeatable sunsets. It’s a popular route to do on nights where there’s a full moon. If you’re relatively fit, you’ll find yourself at the top quite quickly, which is why it’s such a popular after-work hike. There’s a little bit of climbing involved, but there are handholds and chains to help you on your way up and down. You can also take the roundabout way, which skips the climbing part if you are walking with small children or dogs.</p>
    <h3>Kasteel Poort</h3>
    <p>The climb up Kasteel Poort is not for the unfit; although, the Cableway does offer an alternative route for those not up to the walk up. From the top of Kasteel Poort you’ll be able to see all the way across the Twelve Apostles mountain range, and once you reach the front of the mountain, the city views are incredible.</p>
    <h3>Devil's Peak</h3>
    <p>This path zig-zags up from Tafelberg Road (where the Cableway station is) and then takes a steep route up to the peak. There are fantastic views of Table Mountain and the city below once you reach the top.</p>
    <h3>Elephant's Eye</h3>
    <p>The eye of the elephant in question is a large cave in the Silvermine Nature Reserve that, when squinting, resembles the head of these large, majestic creatures. Though all the way across the city from Table Mountain itself, the reserve is still part of park, and has great picnic spots next to the reservoir where you can have a braai.</p>

  <section class="Fishing_section">
    <h1 id="Fishing">Fishing</h1>
    <p>If a heavy tug on your fishing line creates a tug at your heart, recreational fishing, deep sea fishing, saltwater and freshwater fishing in and around Cape Town will certainly stir your fishing passion. Recreational Fishing in and around Cape Town has always been a popular past time. Many fishermen’s journeys are more than likely to end up in Cape Town.  There are excellent fishing spots in a number of places depending on whether you are looking for Big Game Fishing or something more along the lines of a quiet fly-fishing trip. Cape Town also offers both saltwater and freshwater fishing options, raging sea fishing or quiet rivers, streams and trout fishing in dams. The best fishing spots that are closest to Cape Town are in and around False Bay and the Cape Peninsula where you are likely to catch bluefin and yellowfin Tuna.</p>

    <p>In Kommetjie Bay expect the Cape snoek run in the winter season and you can catch white steenbras, stumpnose & galjoen off the rocks at Kommetjie but if you wish to fish off boats and really fight for your line, take a charter 30 nautical miles out from Kommetjie where you can enjoy some of the best deep-sea fishing grounds of the Cape Peninsula and these are home to tuna, albacore, black marlin and the fighting mako shark.</p>

    <p>For fresh water fishing, the Fischerhaven dam is loacted just outside of Hermans and is great for bass, rainbow trout fishing and carp and Theewaterskloof Dam is near Villersdorp on the N2 past Bot River about 120kms outside Cape Town for smallmouth bass, trout and carp.</p>

  <h1 id="Camping">Camping</h1>
  <p>Love camping? So do we. These are some of our favourite Western Cape campsites, our pick of the best camping in the Overberg, Cederberg and Garden Route.</p>

<h3>Secret Falls, Winterhoek mountains</h3>
<p>Who wouldn’t want to have a dip here? From high up on the slopes of the Winterhoek Mountains (the southern edge of the Cederberg range), Secret Falls’ 10, tiered, grassy stands have phenomenal views down the Tulbagh Valley and this little communal pool is a fabulous place from which to take it all in. The only downside is you’ll need a 4X4 to get up there, and of course once you’re up, you won’t want to leave.</p>

<h3>Cederberg Oasis, Cederberg</h3>
<p>Fancy a beautiful camping weekend, but could do without the prep? Cederberg Oasis is your answer. It’s 3.5 hours from Cape Town and has a variety of accommodation options – you don’t even have to take a tent. Or any food either: if you’d rather not cook, a generous breakfast, lunch and dinner is served daily (the steak and chips is excellent), and there’s a fully stocked honesty bar and ice for sale. There’s plenty of grass and a shaded pool area, where you’ll also find hammocks strung up and waiting for your afternoon nap. Just bring yourself. Oasis will provide the rest.</p>

<h3>Houdenbek, Op-die-Berg</h3>
<p>You can’t get more private than one campsite, all to yourself in the wilderness. That’s Houdenbek – an exclusive sliver of rugged beauty on the banks of a small dam in the southern Cederberg. Pitch your tent and light a fire and prepare to do nothing at all, except perhaps a lovely, cooling swim. There’s mountain biking and climbing on offer too if you’re not the kind who likes to sit still.</p>

  <h1 id="Rock Climbing">Rock climbing</h1>
  <p>South Africa is a rock climber’s paradise offering spectacular routes of all grades on fantastic quality rock in pristine mountain environments. Standing in line to get onto the rock is almost unheard of and, if its solitude you are after, you normally don’t need to go too far to find peace and quiet. Various types of climbing is available in grades to suit all levels of experience and ability. Sport Climbing and Traditional Climbing routes can be found in various places all around the country. Long Country Routes, Big Walls and Alpine Rock can be found in places such as the Du Toit’s Kloof Mountains of the Western Cape, the famous and high Drakensberg Mountains or Blouberg in the North.The Western Cape offers some of the best climbing available in the country. If you stay anywhere near Cape Town you can get onto high quality rock routes within minutes. There are loads of sport climbing options at various venues within the Table Mountain National Park and multi-pitch traditional climbing ranging from easy classics to hard test pieces on quality rock.</p>

  <h3>Table Mountain trad rock climbing</h3>
  <p>Standing 1086m tall above the Mother City is arguably South Africa’s most famous landmark, Table Mountain. The city of Cape Town and its suburbs surround the giant 80km long mountain chain stretching from Signal Hill above Table Bay to Cape Point in the South. In Cape Town life literally centres around the mountain. Table Mountain is a World Heritage Site and a proclaimed National Park with great biodiversity and fantastic natural beauty. The mountain offers inspiring traditional rock climbing routes, mostly on high quality Sandstone.</p>

  <h3>Cape Peninsula sport climbing</h3>
  <p>Sport climbing refers to routes that are protected by preplaced bolts on the rock face to clip the safety rope to. Often people who are new to thesport prefer to get used to the equipment and activity by trying sport climbing first as it is less intimidating than trad climbing. The Cape has spectacular sport climbing crags to visit with great routes for all abilities. Most of the Peninsula sport climbing is done on single-pitch routes but some venue such as Paarl Rock do offer multi-pitch sport routes.</p>
